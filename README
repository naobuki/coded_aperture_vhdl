configs/: Contains useful configuration files for kermit and tftp

HOWTO: A howto guide to setting up ubuntu to do FPGA development on the armadeus, using the software in this git repository

kermit_install: A template for installing xilinx bitmaps into the memory of the armedeus FPGA, using kermit to control the armedeus

mask/: An implementation of the logic behind a 1D coded aperture.  Uses c_vhdl for bench-testing.

mask/garrett/: A subdirectory with python code for simulating the HETE SXC

mask/python/: Contains a number of useful python programs for making graphs
