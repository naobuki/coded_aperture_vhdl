Ubuntu Armedeus HOWTO:

• Talk to linux on the armadeus using a serial line:

  First, plug in your USB<>Serial converter to your computer, and then
  connect a null-modem serial cable from the serial converter to the
  armadeus.  Make sure the armadeus is powered up

  To talk to the armadeus, we use two vt100 serial terminal emulator 
  programs.  Here's how you install them:

	> sudo apt-get install gtkterm ckermit

  You will need to have access to the serial device, which means you need to 
  be in the "dialout" group.  Add yourself with this command:

	> sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

  ○ Setting up gtkterm

    Fire up gtkterm:

	> gtkterm

    You will need to set up gtkterm to use the right port and baud rate.  Go 
    to the "Configuration -> Port" menu item.  Select "/dev/ttyUSB0" as the 
    port and select "115200" as the speed.

    At the gtkterm prompt, hit the enter⏎ key.  You should see a login
    prompt:

	Welcome to the Armadeus development environment.
	armadeus login: █

    Type in

	> root

    And hit enter⏎.  It should return "# █".  You are now at the linux 
    prompt on the armadeus, logged in as root.

    You will want to save your configuration.  Go to 
    "Configuration->Save configuration" and type in "armadeus".  You can now 
    load this configuration when you restart GTKTerm by going to  
    "Configuration->Load configuration" and selecting "armadeus"

    You probably want to exit the login shell by typing

	# exit

  ○ Setting up kermit

    You can connect to the armadeus with kermit in the containing this howto
    by typing:

	> kermit -y kermrc -c

    It will then output

	Connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0, speed 115200
	 Escape character: Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28, FS): enabled
	Type the escape character followed by C to get back,
	or followed by ? to see other options.
	----------------------------------------------------
	█

    Hit the enter⏎ key and you should either see the linux login prompt or
    a shell prompt "# █".  If you are in login prompt, you can login to root
    by typing "root".  If you want to quit kermit, type 

	"ctrl-\" followed by "Q"

    You can access the online documentation in kermit by typing
 
	"ctrl-\" followed by "?"

    This displays other commands that kermit accepts.

    The "-y kermrc" option tells kermit to use a custom initialization 
    file.  If you want these settings to always be loaded, type at

	> cp kermrc ~/.kermrc

    I prefer kermit over gtkterm, because a real terminal program lets me 
    scroll back in history while gtkterm does not.

• Settup TFTP for sending files to the Armadeus

  First thing is that you need to download the tftp server in Ubuntu:

  > sudo apt-get install tftpd xinetd

  

• Install the XILINX WebPack for Bitmap Synthesis

  I followed the instructions here:

  http://www.armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=ISE_WebPack_installation_on_Linux

  The first step is to make sure that the following packages are installed 
  in ubuntu:

	> sudo apt-get install libstdc++5 libmotif3 libxp6 libcurl3

  The next step is to download whatever the latest version of the Xilinx 
  ISE.  Go here and download the linux version:

  http://www.xilinx.com/ise/logic_design_prod/webpack.htm

  I recommend making a new account; this will ensure that you have a license
  for the WebPack software.

  As of January 10, 2011 The WebPack is 3.5 GB, so I recommend when 
  downloading that you find something fun to do for ~16 hours.  For
  instance, you could watch an entire season of 24, play Final
  Fantasy 7 from beginning to end, or read the entire Hitch Hiker's Guide 
  to The Galaxy series.  Perhaps you could write up an elaborate HOWTO
  explaining the steps you went through to do FPGA development on linux?  
  They're all nice choices; they point is you have time to burn.

• Install GHDL + GTKWave for Bench Tests

• Install SciPy for Plotting HETE SXC Simulations
